‚Äî Learn the rules in minutes. Master them over many duels.

## What Is Mythical Beings?

Mythical Beings is a fast, tactical, turn-based card game for two players. Each player commands three creatures (mythical beings) and equips them with Knowledge cards (spells/skills) from the Market. Rotate beings to gain wisdom and pay knowledge costs, trigger card effects and passives, and whittle down your opponent‚Äôs power to win.

## Objective

- Reduce your opponent‚Äôs power to 0; or
- When the knowledge deck is exhausted, have more power than your opponent.

## Components At A Glance

- Creatures: Your three beings on the battlefield. Each has a passive ability and gains wisdom by rotating.
- Knowledge Cards: Elemental cards (Aquatic/Water, Terrestrial/Earth, Aerial/Air). Played onto a specific creature‚Äôs slot. Each has a cost, an effect that depends on rotation, and eventually leaves play after a number of rotations.
- Market: The shared row where players draw knowledge from.
- Power: Your life total. When it reaches 0, you lose.
- Hand: Knowledge cards you‚Äôre holding (max size 5).

## Turn Structure (2 Actions Per Turn)

Every turn flows through clear phases:

1) Knowledge Phase
- All knowledge cards on the field rotate +90¬∞.
- Their effects trigger according to the card‚Äôs value cycle (see below).
- Cards that reach their final rotation leave play (discard). ‚ÄúLeaves play‚Äù can trigger passives.

2) Action Phase
- You have 2 actions by default. Typical actions:
  - Draw 1 knowledge from the Market (if space in hand).
  - Summon 1 knowledge from your hand onto one of your creatures.
  - Rotate one of your creatures 90¬∞ to increase its wisdom.
  - End Turn (always allowed when it‚Äôs your turn).

3) End Turn
- Any end-of-turn effects resolve. Turn passes to your opponent.

Notes
- You can‚Äôt take actions if it‚Äôs not your Action Phase.
- Some passives can make specific summons free (don‚Äôt consume actions) or modify normal rules.

## Core Mechanics

Creatures and Wisdom
- Each creature has a current wisdom value that increases with rotation.
- Wisdom pays the cost to summon knowledge onto that creature‚Äôs slot.

Summoning Knowledge
- A creature may hold at most one knowledge card on its slot.
- To summon: the creature‚Äôs current wisdom must be ‚â• the knowledge cost.
- Some slots may be blocked by effects (you can‚Äôt summon there while blocked).

Rotation & Value Cycles
- Each knowledge has a valueCycle, mapping rotation (0¬∞/90¬∞/180¬∞/270¬∞) to the effect‚Äôs strength or behavior.
- During the Knowledge Phase, the effect uses the pre-increment rotation to determine values, then rotates +90¬∞.
- After a number of rotations (maxRotations), the knowledge leaves play (goes to discard).

Leaves Play Triggers
- When a knowledge leaves play, some creatures‚Äô passives react. Example: Lisovik deals 1 damage to the opponent when its owner‚Äôs earth knowledge leaves play.

Damage, Defense, and Power
- Many effects deal damage directly to the opposing player‚Äôs power.
- Some knowledge provides defense or modifies how damage is applied.
- If multiple effects/passives trigger, the game resolves them deterministically and logs the sequence.

Market & Hand
- Draw from the Market into your hand (max hand size: 5).
- The Market refills according to the game rules (see logs/effects for specifics in edge cases).

## Example Turn

Setup: You control Lisovik and two other beings. You‚Äôve summoned an Earth knowledge onto one creature.

1) Knowledge Phase
- Your Earth knowledge triggers at its current rotation and then rotates. If it reaches its final rotation, it‚Äôs discarded. If it was yours and Earth, Lisovik may deal 1 damage on leave.

2) Action Phase (2 actions)
- Action 1: Rotate your second creature to gain wisdom.
- Action 2: Summon an Air knowledge from your hand (you meet the cost thanks to the rotation).

3) End Turn
- Any pending effects resolve. It‚Äôs now your opponent‚Äôs turn.

## Passives & Signature Interactions (Examples)

- Lisovik (Earth synergy): When your Earth knowledge leaves play, deal 1 damage to the opponent.
- Kappa: Summoning Aquatic knowledge can be a free action on Kappa (does not consume actions).
- Dudugera: Summoning onto Dudugera can be free (specific conditions apply).
- Zhar-Ptitsa: Start-of-turn draw; aerial damage may bypass defense in specific checks.
- Tarasca: Punishes opponents when they summon terrestrial knowledge.
- Lafaic: Rotates another friendly knowledge when you summon Aquatic onto Lafaic.

These examples illustrate how passives shape your plan: time rotations, line up leaves-play triggers, and pressure your opponent‚Äôs power.

## Strategy Tips

- Plan around rotations: many effects peak at specific angles. Don‚Äôt waste a strong tick.
- Prepare for leaves-play: set up passives that benefit when your cards rotate out.
- Deny the opponent: block, discard, or rotate their board to disrupt timing.
- Hand discipline: keep space for pivotal Market draws (max 5).
