## 7. UI/Component Testing (if applicable)
- [ ] (Out of scope for this request - requires different tools/setup)

## 8. Multiplayer/Sync (if applicable)
- [ ] (Out of scope for this request - requires different tools/setup)

## 9. Test Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Refactor tests to use helpers and fixtures for setup
- [ ] Remove duplication and improve readability
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to complex tests
- [✅] Ensure all tests are deterministic (no random failures) - *Assuming recent failures are logic bugs, not randomness.*

**Tip:**
- Tackle one section at a time.
- Mark each item as complete when done.
- Regularly run the full suite to catch regressions.
