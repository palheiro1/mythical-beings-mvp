  - [✅] Tarasca: `AFTER_OPPONENT_SUMMON` - If opponent summons terrestrial knowledge, deal 1 damage to opponent summoner. - Covered in `tests/gameReducer/passives/tarasca.test.ts`
- [✅] Test edge cases (multiple passives, stacking, etc.) - Covered in `tests/gameReducer/passives/interactions.test.ts`. *Note: Tests pass, but TODOs added for potential logic issues with chained KNOWLEDGE_LEAVE and AFTER_PLAYER_DRAW triggers.*

## 4. Knowledge Card Effects
- [ ] List all unique knowledge effects from `effects.ts`
- [✅] Basic Damage/Defense application - Covered indirectly in `tests/rules/validation.test.ts`
- [✅] Test specific effects (draw, discard, block, etc.) - Covered in `tests/rules/validation.test.ts`
- [🤼🏾] Test edge cases (stacking, blocked, etc.) - *Partially covered: Blocking tested (aquatic3). Missing: Tests for stacking effects.*
- [🤼🏾] Test log output for effects - *Partially covered: Logs checked for tested effects in `tests/rules/validation.test.ts`. Missing: Comprehensive log checks for all effects.*

## 5. Market, Deck, and Discard Logic

## 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling
- [🤼🏾] Test simultaneous triggers (multiple passives/effects in one phase) - *Partially covered: `interactions.test.ts` exists but has failures. Needs review.*
- [ ] Test user interaction fallbacks (auto-resolve logic)
- [🤼🏾] Test malformed actions and error handling (already partially covered) - *Partially covered: `isValidAction` tests in `tests/rules/validation.test.ts` and invalid turn tests. Missing: More comprehensive error handling.*

## 7. UI/Component Testing (if applicable)
- [ ] (Out of scope for this request - requires different tools/setup)

## 8. Multiplayer/Sync (if applicable)
- [ ] (Out of scope for this request - requires different tools/setup)

## 9. Test Quality & Maintenance
- [ ] Refactor tests to use helpers and fixtures for setup
- [ ] Remove duplication and improve readability
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to complex tests
- [✅] Ensure all tests are deterministic (no random failures) - *Assuming recent failures are logic bugs, not randomness.*

**Tip:**
- Tackle one section at a time.
- Mark each item as complete when done.
- Regularly run the full suite to catch regressions.
