# Knowledge Card Effect Triggers

## Overview

In Mythical Beings MVP, card effects and passives trigger at specific, well-defined moments:
- **onSummon**: When a card is summoned/enters play.
- **onPhase**: Each knowledge phase (rotation step).
- **onFinalRotation**: When a card leaves play due to reaching its max rotation.
- **whileInPlay**: As long as the card remains on the field.
- **TURN_START**: At the start of a player's turn (for passives).
- **AFTER_PLAYER_SUMMON / AFTER_OPPONENT_SUMMON**: After a player or opponent summons a knowledge card.
- **AFTER_PLAYER_DRAW / AFTER_OPPONENT_DRAW**: After a player or opponent draws a card.
- **KNOWLEDGE_LEAVE**: When a knowledge card leaves play (for passives that care about this event).

## Why Standardize Triggers?
- **Clarity**: Developers and designers can see exactly when and how each effect triggers.
- **Consistency**: All effects use the same mechanism, reducing bugs and confusion.
- **Extensibility**: New triggers can be added easily if needed in the future.
- **Testing**: Unit tests can target specific triggers and edge cases.

## Passive Abilities: Standardized Triggers

All creature passives now use a standardized trigger and are documented in code. See the table below for a summary:
