üéÆ NFT Selection Bug Fix - Testing Instructions:

SETUP:
1. Start the development server (npm run dev)
2. Open two browser tabs/windows
3. Navigate to the game creation flow
4. Create a new game and get the game ID

TESTING:
1. Tab A (Player 1): Navigate to /nft-selection/:gameId
2. Tab B (Player 2): Navigate to /nft-selection/:gameId  
3. Player 1: Complete NFT selection first
4. Player 2: Complete NFT selection second
5. EXPECTED: Both players should navigate to /game/:gameId

DEBUGGING:
- Check browser console for realtime subscription logs
- Look for "üéØ NAVIGATION TRIGGER" messages
- Look for "‚è≥ WAITING STATE" messages
- Verify no duplicate subscription channels are created

KEY FIX POINTS:
‚úÖ Single consolidated realtime subscription (game-{gameId}-updates)
‚úÖ Combined navigation logic in handleGameUpdate
‚úÖ Proper state management for both player completion states
‚úÖ No duplicate subscriptions causing race conditions
